This was a team project during our frontend developer course at Codecool.

Our task was to create a website where visitors can browse and search artworks of a chosen museum's gallery (in this case, the Harvard Art Museum).
People who worked on the project and their contributions are:

- Magyar Tibor (https://github.com/MagyarTibor): the search bar
- Belényesi Gábor (https://github.com/Gabor-Belenyesi): loading mask, the header and footer components, and a rudimentary favorite button function
- Her Tímea (https://github.com/Timcsi1): the detailed cards of artworks

They also worked on the design of the page, which turned out to be rather a functional layout with an added background, due to lack of time and the novelty of MUI elements.

I must also add that all of their separate works were later either patched or overwritten by me, as they either didn't reach a functional state, or were not compatible with the overall code and design.

The rest of the project was done by me: the components and their routing, the fetching of data by each component, the MUI elements (loading animation, buttons, pagination) and MUI cards of the artworks, the rendering conditions, and the "favorites" function.

As the course was severely behind schedule at this point, the classes about authentication were skipped, therefore the favorites function was local storage based.
